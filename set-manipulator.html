                SetManipulator
            </h2>
            <p>
                SetManipulator performs standard atonal theory calculations for ordered and unordered pitch and pitch-class collections, as well as contours. 
                Features include operations (T<sub><i>n</i></sub>, I, M<sub><i>m</i></sub>, R, and r<sub><i>r</i></sub>), twelve-tone matrices, subset queries,
                set-complexes K and Kh, and searches for ordered and unordered content under standard TTOs and row operators.
            </p><p>
                It is designed especially for the theoretical approach of Robert Morris, as laid out in <i>Composition with Pitch Classes: A Theory 
                of Compositional Design</i> and the two <i>Class Notes</i> texts. SetManipulator is particularly helpful during the compositional process,
                as it allows you to search for transformations of a pcset or pcesg that contain specific pitches. It is also useful for segmentation,
                supporting a continuous calculation mode that allows you to easily test many different segmentation options without using paper and pencil.

                System Requirements
            </h2>
            <p>
                SetManipulator is compatible with any operating system that supports .NET 6.0. This includes Windows 7/8/10/11, macOS, and Linux. 
                Binaries are only available for Windows at this time, but the source code can be compiled for any of these operating systems.
