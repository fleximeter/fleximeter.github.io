                SetManipulator
            </h2>
            <p>
                SetManipulator performs standard atonal theory calculations for ordered and unordered pitch and pitch-class collections, as well as contours. 
                Features include operations (T<sub><i>n</i></sub>, I, M<sub><i>m</i></sub>, R, and r<sub><i>r</i></sub>), twelve-tone matrices, subset queries,
                set-complexes K and Kh, and searches for ordered and unordered content under standard TTOs and row operators.
            </p><p>
                SetManipulator is particularly helpful during the compositional process,
                as it allows you to search for transformations of a pcset or pcesg that contain specific pitches. It is also useful for segmentation,
                supporting a continuous calculation mode that allows you to easily test many different segmentation options without using paper and pencil.
            </p>
            <h2>
