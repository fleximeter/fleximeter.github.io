                <h2>2. Atonal theory</h2>
                <h3>2.1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Atonal theory is a branch of music theory that deals with atonal music, much of it 
                    written using the twelve-tone method. The theory uses mathematical concepts, most
                    notably from set theory and group theory, to model collections of pitches and pitch-classes
                    and transformations of these collections. It is a flexible model, and offers compositional
                    and analytical insight to many different kinds of music, including some scalar and tonal
                    music. It is particularly helpful when working with nonstandard harmonies in the
                    12&hyphen;EDO system, whether the context is tonal, quasi&hyphen;tonal, or atonal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thorough introduction to atonal theory is beyond the scope of this documentation.
                    Instead, this page explains the conventions used in the pctheory package. These are
                    based on the work of Robert Morris, so readers familiar with <i>Composition with 
                    Pitch&hyphen;Classes: A Theory of Compositional Design</i> should already
                    be familiar with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We begin with pitch&hyphen;classes in twelve&hyphen;tone equal&hyphen;temperament.
                    A pitch&hyphen;class is often represented with a name like C, D, E, etc. In atonal theory,
                    it is often useful to assign a number to each pitch&hyphen;class. So C becomes 0, C&hyphen;sharp
                    becomes 1, D becomes 2, etc. Often theorists use T for 10 and E for 11, but pctheory follows
                    the convention of using A for 10 and B for 11 instead. This avoids confusion with the use of
                    T to represent the transposition operator, and also follows the standard for hexadecimal digits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is also possible to work directly with individual pitches. In pitch&hyphen;space,
                    0 is C4, 1 is C&hyphen;sharp 4, 2 is D4, -1 is B3, -2 is B-flat 3, etc. Positive numbers represent
                    notes above C4 and negative numbers represent notes below C4. This is in contrast to the standard
                    MIDI numbering, where 60 is C4. It is then possible to make sets and permutations of pitches,
                    just as we would with pitch-classes. This is useful when working with Xenakis&apos;s sieves
                    and fixed&hyphen;pitch formations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any collection of pitch-classes, whether a chord, scale, or something else, can be modeled
                    with a mathematical <i>set</i>. A set is written with curly braces {} and contains 0 or more
                    <i>elements</i>. Sets cannot contain duplicate elements, and the elements are not ordered with
                    respect to each other. In atonal theory, we could represent the diatonic scale as the set
                    {4, 9, 0, B, 7, 2, 5}. Often it would be notated {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, B}, which is exactly the
                    same set. I show both orderings to demonstrate that order does not matter in mathematical sets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the pitch-classes are represented as numbers, it is possible to perform mathematical
                    operations on them. All pitch-class operations are done mod 12. Transposition (T) is addition:
                    T<sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i> + <i>n</i> mod 12. Inversion (I) is often defined
                    as I(<i>x</i>) = 0 - <i>x</i> mod 12, but it is also identical to 11<i>x</i> mod 12. We will
                    use the latter definition. The operation of multiplication (M) is defined as 
                    M<sub><i>m</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>mx</i> mod 12. Inversion is M<sub>11</sub>. Other useful
                    M operators are M<sub>5</sub> and M<sub>7</sub>. M<sub>1</sub> is an identity operator; it leaves
                    pitch-classes unchanged. The combined transposition and inversion operator, T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I
                    is redefined as T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub>11</sub>(<i>x</i>) = 11<i>x</i> + <i>n</i> mod 12. The
                    T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub><i>m</i></sub> operator is defined as 
                    T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub><i>m</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>mx</i> + <i>n</i> mod 12.
