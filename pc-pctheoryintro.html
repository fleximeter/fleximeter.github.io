                <h2>2. Atonal theory</h2>
                <h3>2.1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Atonal theory is a branch of music theory that deals with atonal music, much of it 
                    written using the twelve-tone method. The theory uses mathematical concepts, most
                    notably from set theory and group theory, to model collections of pitches and pitch-classes
                    and transformations of these collections. It is a flexible model, and offers compositional
                    and analytical insight to many different kinds of music, including some scalar and tonal
                    music. It is particularly helpful when working with nonstandard harmonies in the
                    12&hyphen;EDO system, whether the context is tonal, quasi&hyphen;tonal, or atonal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thorough introduction to atonal theory is beyond the scope of this documentation.
                    Instead, this page explains the conventions used in the pctheory package. These are
                    based on the work of Robert Morris, so readers familiar with <i>Composition with 
                    Pitch&hyphen;Classes: A Theory of Compositional Design</i> should already
                    be familiar with them.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2. Pitch and pitch&hyphen;class</h3>
                <p>
                    We begin with pitch&hyphen;classes in twelve&hyphen;tone equal&hyphen;temperament.
                    A pitch&hyphen;class is often represented with a name like C, D, E, etc. In atonal theory,
                    it is often useful to assign a number to each pitch&hyphen;class. So C becomes 0, C&#x266f;
                    becomes 1, D becomes 2, D&#x266f; becomes 3, etc. Often theorists use T for B&#x266d; and E for 
                    B&#x266e; instead of the numbers 10 and 11, but pctheory follows
                    the convention of using A and B instead of T and E. This avoids confusion with the use of
                    T to represent the transposition operator, and also follows the standard for hexadecimal digits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also possible to work directly with individual pitches. In pitch&hyphen;space,
                    0 is C4, 1 is C&#x266f;4, 2 is D4, -1 is B3, -2 is B&#x266d;3, etc. Positive numbers represent
                    notes above C4 and negative numbers represent notes below C4. This is in contrast to the standard
                    MIDI numbering, where 60 is C4. It is then possible to make sets and permutations of pitches,
                    just as we would with pitch-classes. This is useful when working with Xenakis&apos;s sieves
                    and fixed&hyphen;pitch formations.
                </p>
                <h3>2.3. Sets</h3>
                <p>
                    Any collection of pitch-classes, whether a chord, scale, or something else, can be modeled
                    with a mathematical <i>set</i>. A set is written with curly braces {} and contains 0 or more
                    <i>elements</i>. Sets cannot contain duplicate elements, and the elements are not ordered with
                    respect to each other. In atonal theory, we call sets of pitch&hyphen;classes <i>pcsets</i>.
                    We could represent the diatonic scale as the pcset
                    {4, 9, 0, B, 7, 2, 5}. Often it would be notated {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, B}, which is exactly the
                    same set. I show both orderings to demonstrate that order does not matter in mathematical sets.
                </p>
                <h3>2.4. Unordered operations</h3>
                <p>
                    Because the pitch-classes are represented as numbers, it is possible to perform mathematical
                    operations on them. All pitch-class operations are done mod 12. Transposition (T) is addition:
                    T<sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i> + <i>n</i> mod 12. Inversion (I) is often defined
                    as I(<i>x</i>) = 0 - <i>x</i> mod 12, but it is also identical to 11<i>x</i> mod 12. We will
                    use the latter definition. The operation of multiplication (M) is defined as 
                    M<sub><i>m</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>mx</i> mod 12. Inversion is M<sub>11</sub>. Other useful
                    M operators are M<sub>5</sub> and M<sub>7</sub>. M<sub>1</sub> is an identity operator; it leaves
                    pitch-classes unchanged. The combined transposition and inversion operator, T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I
                    is redefined as T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub>11</sub>(<i>x</i>) = 11<i>x</i> + <i>n</i> mod 12.
                    The general T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub><i>m</i></sub> operator is defined as 
                    T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub><i>m</i></sub>(<i>x</i>) = <i>mx</i> + <i>n</i> mod 12.
                    Any T<sub><i>n</i></sub> or T<sub><i>n</i></sub>M<sub><i>m</i></sub> operator can be represented
                    using the <span class="code pyClass">UTO</span> class.
                </p>
                <h3>2.5. Set-classes</h3>
                <p>
                    Any two pcsets that can be mapped into each other under the operations of transposition
                    and/or inversion can be said to belong to the same <i>set&hyphen;class</i>. Any 
                    set&hyphen;class can be represented by its <i>prime form</i>, a special set in the class. The calculation
                    of prime forms is beyond the scope of this documentation, and is done automatically in pctheory
                    using the <span class="code pyClass">SetClass12</span> class. There are 224 set&hyphen;classes
                    in the chromatic system.
                </p>
                <h3>2.6. Rows, permutations, and segments</h3>
                <p>
                    Twelve&hyphen;tone rows are nonduplicative orderings of the twelve pitch&hyphen;classes.
                    This means they are mathematical permutations. In atonal theory, permutations of pitch&hyphen;classes
                    are often called pitch&hyphen;class segments, or pcsegs. A pcseg may or may not
                    have duplicate pitch&hyphen;classes, and can be of any length. A row is a 12&hyphen;note
                    nonduplicative pcseg. The pctheory package has multiple functions for generating random pcsegs.
                    Any melody can be modeled as a pcseg, or more precisely as a pitch segment (pseg). Any chord
                    may also be modeled as a pcseg or pseg &ndash; whether the ordering is from top to bottom or from
                    bottom to top is arbitrary.
                </p>
                <h3>2.7. Microtonal pitch and pitch-classes</h3>
                <p>
                    The pctheory package contains functionality for working with the 24-tone equally&hyphen;tempered
                    microtonal scale. Microtonal pitch&hyphen;classes are represented with the numbers 0 to 23,
                    written as 00, 01, 02, ... 21, 22, 23. Microtonal pitches follow the same convention as chromatic
                    pitches, but now we move up a quarter&hyphen;step with each number instead of a half&hyphen;step.
                    Pcsets (and pcsegs) can be made of microtonal pitch&hyphen;classes. The functionality for microtonal pcsets is
                    somewhat more limited because of the comparatively enormous number of microtonal set&hyphen;classes
                    &ndash; 352,698 set&hyphen;classes total.
