                <h2>2. Command List</h2>
                <p>
                    Commands are displayed in verbose form, followed by a short form in parentheses. Obviously, a user will prefer the short form 
                    for efficiency. If you use a command that is unavailable, the program will display an error message. (For example, you cannot 
                    display an interval-class vector for an ordered pcseg, or a twelve-tone matrix for an unordered pcset.)
                </p><p>
                    Pitch classes are displayed in integer notation (0123456789AB). While the program always displays A and B in uppercase, pitch-class 
                    input is not case-sensitive. Microtonal pitch-classes are displayed as 2-digit integers (00, 01, 02, ..., 21, 22, 23). Pitches are 
                    displayed as integers, where middle C is 0, pitches below middle C are negative, and pitches above middle C are positive. When 
                    entering pitch-classes, individual pcs should not be separated by space or comma. When entering pitches or microtonal pitch-classes, 
                    individual pitches should be separated by a comma and no space. For example, 59B is a pc-string and -5,0,10,15 is a p-string. 
                </p><p>
                    When working with unordered pitch-class collections, pcsets do not need to be in the prime form for their set-classes. However, all 
                    transformations are performed on the current pcset. If you want all transformations to be relative to the prime form of a set-class, 
                    you will need to load a prime form either by entering it manually using the <span class="code">load</span> command, or automatically 
                    using the <span class="code">load prime</span> command.
                </p><p>
                    Commands marked with a * may be followed by a pc-string or p-string. The only commands that change the collection currently in memory 
                    are the Load commands; therefore, a command like <span class="code">info 015</span> will not change the set that is currently being stored.
                </p>

                                or pitch-classes. Order only matters for pcsegs and psegs. If you include a pitch (or pitches) after the 
                                “Search” command, it will search for the provided input. Otherwise, you will enter continuous search mode,
                                where you can perform multiple searches &ndash; type &apos;q&apos; to quit.

                                Convert current cseg to cseg-class prime form. If you include pitches after the LP command, the LP command loads a new cseg 
                                and converts it to the prime form of its cseg-class.

                <h3>2.8. Transformations (case sensitive)</h3>
                <p>
                    Transformations may be performed together as a command string. The last transformation in the string will be performed first, 
                    then the next-to-last transformation, and so forth. You must include an integer with the <span class="code">M</span> and 
                    <span class="code">T</span> transformations. <span class="code">M</span> is not 
                    automatically interpreted as M<sub>5</sub>. For example, the transformation string <span class="code">M7T9I</span> first inverts 
                    the collection, then transposes it by 9, and finally multiplies it by 7. If the collection is unordered, the result of the 
                    transformation will be displayed in sorted order. 
                    Also note that all transformations are performed mod 12. Therefore, <span class="code">T85</span> produces the same result as 
                    <span class="code">T1</span>. Transpositions of pcsets are 
                    performed on the provided set &ndash; if you intend to transform relative to the prime form of a set-class, you must load a prime form. 
                    Negative numbers are not supported.
                </p><p>
                    Multiple transformation strings may be performed simultaneously. For example, if you enter <span class="code">T5M5I</span> 
                    <span class="code">IM7T5I</span> at the prompt, both transformation strings will be evaluated individually, and the results will 
                    be displayed in a list. This is useful if you wish to compare the results of different transformation strings.
                </p><p>
                    You can also provide a specific collection as the final item in a list of transformation strings. For example, 
                    transforms {08A1} by T<sub>5</sub>M<sub>5</sub>I. 
                    If you are in unordered pc-mode, <span class="code">08A1</span> will be evaluated as a pcset. In ordered pc-mode, 
                    <span class="code">08A1</span> will be evaluated as a pcseg, and so forth. 
                    This feature makes it possible to transform subsidiary collections without changing what is currently stored in memory.
