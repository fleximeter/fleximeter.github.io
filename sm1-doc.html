                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <h3>1.1. Basic concepts</h3>
                <p>
                    SetManipulator operates in seven modes: ordered pitch-class, ordered microtonal pitch-class, ordered pitch, ordered contour-pitch, 
                    unordered pitch-class, unordered microtonal pitch-class, and unordered pitch. The mode that you are in determines which features 
                    are immediately available.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Nomenclature in this program follows the conventions of Robert Morris's <i>Composition with Pitch Classes: A Theory of Compositional Design</i>.
                    By default, SetManipulator calculates prime forms by packing from the right. However, packing to the left is available as an option. This setting
                    only affects a handful of set-classes in the chromatic system.
                </p>
                <h3>1.2. Installation</h3>
                <p>
                    Binaries for Windows are located in the folder SetManipulator/SetManipulator/bin/Release/net6.0/. Copy them to a directory on your computer 
                    (for example, a folder in the C:\Program Files directory). You will need to install the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">
                    .NET Desktop Runtime 6.x</a> to run SetManipulator. 
                </p>
