            <p>
                pctheory is a Python library for using atonal music theory. Ordered and unordered collections use basic Python
                data structures like set and list. The library features extensive functionality, including operations 
                (T<sub><i>n</i></sub>, I, M<sub><i>m</i></sub>, R, and r<sub><i>r</i></sub>) as well as general TTO and RO classes
                for standardized opreators, twelve-tone matrices, invariance matrices, rotational arrays, array operations, searches,
                subsets, microtonal support, and much more.
            </p><p>
                pctheory is much more specialized than music21, and offers substantially more functionality in atonal theory. It is designed
                especially for the theoretical approach of Robert Morris, as laid out in <i>Composition with Pitch Classes: A Theory 
                of Compositional Design</i> and the two <i>Class Notes</i> texts. Additionally, it does not use music21 objects,
                so there is less computational overhead when using pctheory. It is not difficult to create music21 objects from pctheory
                objects, which allows pctheory to be used along with music21.

            <h2>System Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                pctheory requires Python 3.0 or newer.
            </p>
